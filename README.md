# Merub Shaikh — Building AI-Powered Solutions & Scalable Full-Stack Systems

## About

I'm a Software Engineer and Master's student at Illinois Institute of Technology passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real problems. From architecting RAG pipelines and designing RESTful APIs to creating intuitive full-stack applications, I thrive at the intersection of AI, backend engineering, and developer experience. Currently working as an Applied Research Associate, translating user insights into accessible technology solutions.

## What I'm Passionate About

- Building production-ready AI systems (RAG pipelines, LangChain, prompt engineering)
- Full-stack development with performance and scalability in mind
- Backend architecture and API design that developers love to use
- Developer tools and automation that eliminate friction
- Creating accessible technology that empowers everyone

## Featured Projects

1. **PaperChat** (AI/RAG) - Production RAG pipeline using LangChain & OpenAI API for semantic search across research papers. Built complete architecture: document parsing → chunking → embeddings → Pinecone vector storage → natural language Q&A interface.
   
2. **Backend Migration** (NestJS) - Led Express.js to NestJS migration for production system, reducing technical debt by 40% and improving query performance by 30% through PostgreSQL & Prisma optimization.
   
3. **LinkedIn Job Tracker** (Chrome Extension) - Chrome extension (Manifest V3) with automatic job application tracking, duplicate detection, and Google Sheets integration. Built serverless REST API for data validation and analytics.
   
4. **Deepfake Filter** (Computer Vision) - Real-time deepfake detection system using OpenCV, TensorFlow & PyTorch for video streaming platforms. Developed efficient algorithms for frame analysis and automated content moderation.

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL  
**Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, HTML/CSS  
**Backend:** Node.js (NestJS, Express), Django (learning), REST APIs  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Prisma ORM, Pinecone (Vector DB)  
**AI/ML:** LangChain, OpenAI API, RAG Pipelines, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV  
**DevOps & Tools:** Git, GitHub Actions, CI/CD, Jenkins, Docker, Vercel  
**Testing:** Playwright, Cypress, Jest  
**Cloud:** AWS (learning), Vercel, Google Cloud Platform

## 🏆 Highlights

- 🎓 Master's student at Illinois Tech with **4.0 GPA** (Software Engineering specialization)
- 💼 Software Engineer with experience improving **query performance by 30%** and reducing **technical debt by 40%**
- 🏅 **Hackathon Winner**: Runner-up at DevDay (Systems Ltd), Top 10 at ACM-W, Winner at Built By Her

- 📚 Dean's List honoree (Spring 2021 & 2023) during Bachelor's in Computer Science
- 🚀 Built 15+ reusable React components accelerating UI development by **25%**
- 🤖 Hands-on experience with RAG systems, prompt engineering, and autonomous agents

## Beyond Code 🌍

I believe great engineering is about more than writing elegant code—it's about understanding users, building tools that empower teams, and creating technology that improves lives. As an international student from Pakistan, I've learned to be resourceful, adaptable, and relentless in solving problems. When I'm not coding, I'm exploring the latest in AI research, contributing to open source, or mentoring fellow students.
